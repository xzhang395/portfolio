            <p>
                This project is
                <a href="https://developer.mastercard.com/blog/innovating-with-academia?platform=hootsuite" target="_blank">sponsored by Mastercard</a> with the goal of exploring the future of payment authentication. At the end of
                the 7-month we synthesized all research and findings to create a UX Guideline for using Continuous Authentication
                for Mastercard designers or anyone interested in adopting the technology.
                <a href="https://aroonm.github.io/MCUXG/index.html" target="_blank">Here is the link to the UX Guideline website.

            <h2>The paradox between convenience and security</h2>

            <div class="project-img-div-small">
                <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/MC/whatif-22.png" alt="authentication">
            </div>
            <p>Complex password, security questions, two-factor authentication…
                <b>Technologies that make us more secure are also generally inconvenient.</b> This is because current authentication
                technology requires active input from the users to verify their identity.
                <b>What if we can be verified by the things we are already doing at any moment?</b>
            </p>
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h2>Continuous Authentication technology can be a solution the paradox</h2>
            <div class="project-img-div-small">
                <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/MC/factors.png" alt="factors">
            </div>
            <p>We define Continuous Authentication as
                <b>"a system that verifies who you are, whenever you need it, without you thinking about it."</b> It uses
                <b>machine learning and massive amounts of data</b>, to notice
                <b>patterns in card use</b> in aggregate as well as
                <b>behaviors unique to individuals.</b>
            </p>

            </div>

            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <p>Since data is being collected and verified from users’ existing activity,continuous authentication can be used
                <b>without any active user input.</b> And it is
                <b>more secure</b> than any existing authentication methods because of the massive amount of data being verified.</p>
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h2>However, the challenges are in the user perception</h2>

            </div>
            <p>Despite the potential benefits, without a clear mental model of the new technology, people are
                <b>concerned with its reliability and security.</b> How can we design for Continuous Authentication so that
                it is both
                <b>convenient and trust-worthy?</b>

                <b>Communication becomes crucial at this initial phase.</b> A
