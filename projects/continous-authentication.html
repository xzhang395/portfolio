            <p>
                This project is
                <a href="https://developer.mastercard.com/blog/innovating-with-academia?platform=hootsuite" target="_blank">sponsored by Mastercard</a> with the goal of exploring the future of payment authentication. At the end of
                the 7-month we synthesized all research and findings to create a UX Guideline for using Continuous Authentication
                for Mastercard designers or anyone interested in adopting the technology.
                <a href="https://aroonm.github.io/MCUXG/index.html" target="_blank">Here is the link to the UX Guideline website.

            <h2>The paradox between convenience and security</h2>

            <!-- <div class="project-img-div-med">
                <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/Bento/senarios.png" alt="collaborative search senarios">
            </div> -->
            <p>Complex password, security questions, two-factor authentication…
                <b>Technologies that make us more secure are also generally inconvenient.</b> This is because current authentication
                technology requires active input from the users to verify their identity.
                <b>What if we can be verified by the things we are already doing at any moment?</b>
            </p>
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h2>Continuous Authentication technology can be a solution the paradox</h2>
            <p>We define Continuous Authentication as
                <b>"a system that verifies who you are, whenever you need it, without you thinking about it."</b> It uses
                <b>machine learning and massive amounts of data</b>, to notice
                <b>patterns in card use</b> in aggregate as well as
                <b>behaviors unique to individuals.</b>
            </p>
            <div class="project-img-div-small">
                <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/MC/factors.png" alt="factors">
            </div>
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <p>Since data is being collected and verified from users’ existing activity,continuous authentication can be used
                <b>without any active user input.</b> And it is
                <b>more secure</b> than any existing authentication methods because of the massive amount of data being verified.</p>
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h2>However, the challenges are in the user perception</h2>
            <div class="project-img-div-small">
                <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/MC/concerns.png" alt="concerns">
            </div>
            <p>Despite the potential benefits, without a clear mental model of the new technology, people are
                <b>concerned with its reliability and security.</b> How can we design for Continuous Authentication so that
                it is both
                <b>convenient and trust-worthy?</b>

            <p>Mia is on the bus while getting a notification from her bank about a new service. Through her bank app, Mia signs
                up for the service, learns how it works, and gives consent to data collection.</p>

            <p>After she’s signed up, there’s a period of time where her profile is created. Mia would shop online as she normally
                does while the system is recording several different factors about Mia and learning her behaviors.

            <p>Once Mia’s profile has been fully generated, it can start working to authenticate a person quickly, easily and

                all the fields for her.

            <p>However, there will be times when behaviour doesn’t match with the usual behavior of Mia, for example, if she
                gets hacked. The system would detect that the typing pattern and mouse movement is different from Mia and
                would challenge the user to verify her identity through security step-ups. </p>
            <p> Steps up is an industry term of system requiring another layer of security. One common step up is to enter a
                code sent to phone. If the user is able to complete the step-up, she can go back to the normal checkout flow.

            <h3 id='s5' class='section'>UX GUIDELINES</h3>
            <p>Summarizing all the findings and insights, we came up with UX guidelines for using continuous authentication.
                Here are some of our top guidelines for each step on the customer journey.</p>
            <h2>1. First exposure: Communication for Trust</h2>
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/MC/emoji.png" alt="pager study">
            </div>
            <p>The technology is so new that people have many doubts when getting first exposed to it.
                <b>Communication becomes crucial at this initial phase.</b> A
                <b>clear drop in emotions</b> can be observed from the emoji graph when continuous authentication starts taking
                effect and information begins populating automatically.
            </p>
            <div class="space15px"></div>

                <b>10 of the participants received a pop-up about the service and had choice to opt-in or opt-out during it</b>.
                However, none of the participants remembered if they even clicked on the button or even saw the message.

            <h2>Small things make a big difference</h2>
            <p>Another thing we found is that small things do make a big impact on security perception.
            </p>
            <p>People responded very well to specific elements of the UI conveying safety and security. For example, the Mastercard
                logo, as well as checkmarks next to it, made people feel that they are verified and it was “very secure.”
                While this does not make the site necessarily more secure, it can reinforce the perception of security quickly
                for a user.

            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <p>Like UI elements, text, even if not read closely can communicate security. A “Data is Encrypted” phrase and a
                link to the Privacy Policy - even if it wasn’t clicked on, made people feel much more secure. Just having
                a link to a Privacy Policy made the site feel safer for some users. And phrases such as browsing behavior
                makes people feel more nervous than simply saying “data”.
