            <h4>October 2017 (3 weeks)
                <br> Class Project for
                <i>Interaction Design Studio</i><br>

            <h3 id='s1' class='section'>INTRO</h3>
            <p>
                For this project, we want to explore how shared economy can be used for medical emergency. We started with conducting gorilla
                research and quickly generate a wide variety of scenarios to confirm needs. The initial need-finding highlighted
                that not having convenient access to emergency medication is a real issue that is unsolved.
                <br>
                <br> The goal of this project is to make emergency medication more available to people in need. My role is to
                <b>use research to identify and reframe problems, challenge the current interaction patterns, and embody ideas
                    through prototyping.</b>
                </b>
            </p>

            <h3 id='s2' class='section'>PROBLEM SPACE</h3>
            <h2>People don’t have convenient access to medication that could save their lives</h2>
            <p>People with chronic conditions like asthma and allergy are burdened to pay for and carry around medical devices
                all day in case of emergency. Such devices are expensive and inconvenient to carry. However, not having immediate
                access to those devices can risk their lives.
            </p>

            </div>
            <h4>For asthma alone, millions of hospitals visits and thousands of deaths can be avoided if having access to medication
                in time.</h4>

            <h3 id='s3' class='section'>NEEDFIDING</h3>
            <h2>Conducting guerrilla research to understand the current state</h2>
            <p>
                We interviewed 12 people with asthma and food allergy as well as EMT (Emergency Medical Technician). Here are some interview
                highlights:

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>Synthesizing interview insights and secondary research, we identified key issues of current system: </p>
            <ul class="text-list">
                <li>
                    <b>Emergency devices and medicine are very expensive</b>
                    <br>One pack of Epipen costs $600, each patient needs at least two packs – one for home, one for school/work
                    place.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>People often forget to carry their medicine or stop carrying them</b>
                    <br>Only less than 30% patients who are subscribed to Epipen carry it with them all the time.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Many devices go unused and expire</b>
                    <br>EpiPens only have a one-year shelf life. About 99 percent of them expire on shelves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id='s4' class='section'>REFRAME AND ITERATE</h3>
            <h2>Reframe the question</h2>
            <p><b>What if instead of every patient owns a set of medical devices, the recourses are shared in a community?</b></p>

            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h2>Concept: Medshare</h2>
            <p>Our solution is MedShare. <b>Instead of one person buying and keeping all the medicine in case of emergency, MedShare allows people to share the medicine at the exact time when it is needed. </b></p>
            <p>MedShare collaborates with Uber and Lyft. Drivers who sign up to be a helper would carry the medical devices in the car and deliver them on receiving an emergency  request. </p>

            <h2>Personas</h2>

                </div>
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h2>Need Validation</h2>
            <p>In order to test whether the user recognize the need, we presented to them a simple storyboard illustration the problem and solution. The feedback shows both positive reactions to the underlying need and some concerns.</p>
            <div class="project-img-div-med">
                <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/medshare/storyboard.png" alt="storyboard">
            </div>
            <div class="speech-bubble"> <p><span class="quote">&ldquo;</span>I can see this idea saving lots of lives. However, <b>I would be worried about getting into legal trouble</b> if I were the helper.</p></div>
            <div class="speech-bubble-r"><p><span class="quote">&ldquo;</span>I like the idea of always being covered. <b>But I would have some trust issues</b>: will the driver be on time? Is the driver trained for using and keeping those devices?</p></div>
            <div class="speech-bubble"><p><span class="quote">&ldquo;</span>So the goal here is that no one need to carry any medical devices, but <b>what if people rely too much on this service</b> and don't carry any medication even when traveling to places where the service is not provided?</p></div>
            <br>
            <p>We recognize legal regulations to be a major barrier to this concept. However, we believe regulation to be adaptable to technology advancement, so the discussion about legal concern is out of scope for this project.<br>
            <b>The challenge is to help users build a sense of trust in our service while understand the risks and take alternative actions if needed.</b></p>
            <div class="space15px"></div>
            <h2>Iterations</h2>
            <p>We created a screen map to identify all the screens needed and prioritize the most important screens.</p>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>We had a sketching session as a group to explore designs alternatives. A mid-fidelity prototype is then made for testing.</p>
