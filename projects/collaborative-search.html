            <p>“Research shows that
                <b>people frequently try to search for information with other people.</b> The fact that
                <b>no user interface for collaborative searching has yet caught fire</b> suggests that the best parts of the
                design space have yet to be investigated.”
                <br>
                <br> This project is sponsored by Google and NSF, with the goal to build an efficient tool for complex exploratory
                search task. My role as a designer on the team is to design the flow and interaction for collaboration features.

            <p>This project is still work-in-progress.

            <h2>People are searching collaboratively without the benefit of specialized tools</h2>
            <!-- <p>People search in groups is currently making do by using existing communication tools, especially email, texting,
                phone calls, and social media communication.</p> -->

            </div>
            <p>However, there is no successful tool to support collaborative search tasks.
                <b>Instead, people are making do by adapting to currently available tools for difference parts in a collaborative
                    search process.</b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>For this project, we want to understand
                <b>what difficulties do people currently have when search collaboratively and how can we improve the experience.</b>
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                <b>But is a specialized search tool needed?</b> To answer this fundamental question, we did retrospective interviews
                with 10 people regarding their recent experience on collaborative search (trip planning, apartment hunting,
                academic and professional research), two key problems observed are:</p>

                Here are what we learnt from literature review:

            <br>
            <h2>People search together in scenarios ranging from professional to entertainment</h2>
            <p>Bento is positioned as a general search tool for everyday use, so it is important to understand all use scenarios.
                All scenarios should fall into these 3 categories:</p>
            <ul class='text-list'>
                <li>
                    <b>Selecting a few from many similar choices</b>
                    <br>(e.g. travel planning, apartment hunting, shopping)</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Covering a topic thoroughly</b>
                    <br>(e.g. academic reference search, legal document search)</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Discovering unknown information</b>
                    <br>(e.g. crowd-sourcing a difficult mathematics proof)</li>

                <b>Research tools for collaborative search is not new.</b>
                Why would people rather repurpose communication technologies than using thses specialized tools? According to a
                <a
                    href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2531617" target="_blank">research study</a>
                    on Coagmento and Diigo -- two collaborative search tools that are currently available on the market,
                    <b>both tools have several design issues that lead to poor users adoption.</b>

            <p>Although impossible to test the real tool, by recreating the experience based on the paper, we can see it takes
                a user many steps to reach a simple goal, which made the software complicated to use or navigate. </p>
            <br>
            <P>
